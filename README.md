# LetRewards


Hosted on Pagodabox.io

I have been uploading it to Pagodabox via Git using a tool called Sourcetree. To make updates yourself,
download Sourcetree.

Once you have done that, open Sourcetree and clone the Url from the Admin page of the Pagoda account:
git@git.pagodabox.io:apps/letrewards.git 

This should create a copy on your computer that you can manipulate. Any time you want to push updates, 
select the checkbox "Unstaged files", then write a message about what you are changing. Don't forget to 
check the box under that says "Push changes immediately to origin/master."

If for some reason the Clone from Pagodabox doesn't work, you clone this Github repository onto your computer. 
There's a button at the bottom of the right sidebar that says "clone in desktop." Github is more of a backup. 

I hope that all makes sense, call with any questions.
